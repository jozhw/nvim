# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Note: Began using semantic version control for this project on 2024-02-13.
This means that all previous pull requests had no versioning control, so
I decided to start from v1.0.0. This is mainly to keep a summary all of the major
changes for each pull request instead of having to go through git history.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-23

- Fix deprecated v3.x lsp-zero functionalities.
- Remove neorg
- Remove none-lsp (null-lsp)
- Add startup.log script to log nvim startup times

## [1.0.1] - 2024-02-15

- Update all plugins and update lsp-zero v2 to lsp-zero v3.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-02-13
